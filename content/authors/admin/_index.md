I am a researcher at Criteo, focusing on *bandit algorithms* and *reinforcement learning*. I received my PhD in 2021; I was lucky to be supervised by Olivier Fercoq and Marc Abeille.

Recently, I mainly worked on understanding how to learn from structured bandit feedback in *non-linear* (and non-stationary) environments. With collaborators we derived minimax-optimal guarantees for Generalized Linear Bandits, solving a problem that had been open for more then 10 years. Beyond the theoretical results, we introduced new algorithms that improve state-of-the-art performances on highly relevant practical problems such as the Logistic Bandit.
